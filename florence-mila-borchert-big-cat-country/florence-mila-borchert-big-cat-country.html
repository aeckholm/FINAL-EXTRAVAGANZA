                            Snow leopards are native to the mountains of central Asia. More specifically in Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Their primary diet is sheep and wild goats. Snow leopards have large paws that have a lot of fur on the bottom. This allows them to have traction on the snow and protection from sharp objects. Their tail is long and thick, which allows them to wrap it around their body for extra warmth. They normally weigh around 60 to 120 pounds.

                            Cheetahs are native to Iran and Sub-Saharan Africa. Their diet consists of birds, gazelles, hares, warthogs, and wildebeest calves. The word cheetah comes from a Hindi word that means a spotted one. Compared to other cats, cheetahs have lean bodies and long legs. Another fact is that the black spots under their eyes can reduce glare from the sun and enhance their vision. Cheetahs weigh around 75 to 145 pounds. They also normally live from around 8 to 12 years.

                            Red pandas are native to Central China, Nepal, and Northern Myanmar. Their diet consists of acorns, bamboo, eggs, fruit, and roots. Despite their name, they are not closely related to giant pandas. Red pandas are housed in Florence Mila Borchert Big Cat Country because they are from the same wild habitats as some of the other cats. Red pandas like to climb and sit high in their habitat. Adult red pandas weigh around 12 to 20 pounds. Their life span is around 13 years.
