            <p class="about">MKE County Zoo Guide is a website that allows you to research the 
                animals in the zoo before visiting. This site is about certain 
                mammals in different habitats. The habitats include Adventure Africa, 
                African Waterhole, Florence Mila Borchert Big Cat Country, North America, 
                Northwestern Mutual Family Farm, and Primates of the world. This site 
                currently only showcases three animals in each habitat. I wanted to create 
                this website to make zoo visitors more aware of what they are going to see 
                and how they can be better prepared. </p>
