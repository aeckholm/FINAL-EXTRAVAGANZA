                            Caribou are native to the northern regions of Asia, Europe, Greenland, 
                            and North America. In North America, these animals are known as Caribou 
                            but in Europe they are referred to as Reindeer. Caribou travel north in 
                            herds in summer and are considered one of the largest animal migrations 
                            on Earth. Their primary diet is vegetation, and they dig for their food 
                            with their large hooves. The female caribous can weigh up to 300 pounds, 
                            and the male caribous can weigh up to 600 pounds.

                            Harbor Seals are native to the North Atlantic and Northern Pacific Oceans. 
                            Their diet is fish, more specifically cod, flounder, herring, mackerel, rockfish, 
                            and salmon. These seals are able to dive down to depths of 500 feet. One of the 
                            longest dives was recorded at 1,460 feet. They breathe air, but they can stay under
                             water for up to 30 minutes at a time. Male harbor seals weigh between 120 pounds 
                             to 300 pounds. Whereas the Females can weigh from 100 pounds to 190 pounds.

                            The Grizzly Bear is native to Western North America. 
                            Their diet includes berries, fish, fruit, leaves, nuts, 
                            rodents, and roots. Grizzly bears like to congregate 
                            together when the salmon swims upstream, which is called
                             summer spawning. Surprisingly, grizzly bears can run up
                              to 30 miles per hour even when an adult bear can weigh
                               up to 800 pounds. These bears have lived for around 25 
                               years, and the mother bears are very protective of their cubs.
